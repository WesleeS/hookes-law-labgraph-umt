# hookes-law-labgraph-umt
Written on Tuesday and then edited a little bit today-- ignore some of my commenting as its now deprecated as I wrote it while the Hooke's law code was accessible. 
Further, the axis titles on the saved plot are incorrect, as I edited the code today on mobile and as such can't regenerate the graphic.
